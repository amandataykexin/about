      <div class="line">I’m not wealthy. I’m not even stable. I’m a fugitive trying to survive — scraping by just to keep a roof over my head.</div>
      <div class="line">But even with so little, I gave everything to her.</div>

      <div class="line">She had debts — <span class="strong">I cleared them.</span></div>
      <div class="line">Said she was hungry — <span class="strong">I fed her.</span></div>
      <div class="line">Needed cab fare — <span class="strong">I paid.</span></div>
      <div class="line">Gambling losses? — <span class="strong">I covered them.</span></div>

      <div class="line">Then came more. She asked me to pay for her <span class="strong">teeth</span>, her <span class="strong">dad’s pocket money</span>, and even her <span class="strong">flight expenses</span>.</div>

      <div class="line">In just <span class="strong">one week</span>, I gave her <span class="strong">$2,400</span>.</div>

      <div class="line">And what did I get in return?</div>
      <div class="line">She brought men home. She cheated. She video called other guys while pretending to talk to me.</div>

      <div class="line">While I was out working, tired, pushing myself to get more money to help her — she was entertaining other men like I didn’t exist.</div>

      <div class="line">Then came the Kpods. I paid for three. She told me they were gone and gave me a half-used one. I didn’t even argue.</div>

      <div class="line">But later, I found a <span class="strong">full Kpod hidden in her pants</span>.</div>

      <div class="line">After all the sacrifices I made — even that, she chose to lie about.</div>
      <div class="line">She took everything until there was nothing left.</div>
      <div class="line">And now she dares to say life is unfair?</div>

      <div class="line"><span class="strong">Retribution</span> is coming.</div>

      <div class="line">She may not see it now, but karma doesn’t forget.</div>
      <div class="line">What she did wasn’t just selfish — it was heartless, calculated, and cold.</div>

      <div class="line"><span class="strong">And karma always collects.</span></div>
