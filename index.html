    <h1 style="text-align:center; text-transform:uppercase;">Affidavit of Facts</h1>

    <p>I, <strong>SG AHSIAO</strong>, of <strong>Singapore</strong>, do hereby solemnly affirm and state as follows:</p>

    <p>1. I am a <strong>Singaporean</strong>, of sound mind and over the age of 21. This affidavit is made voluntarily and based on personal knowledge of the facts herein.</p>

    <p>2. This affidavit outlines my interactions and relationship with Amanda Tay Ke Xin, which took place between July 2024 and June 2025.</p>

    <p>3. In July 2024, I met Amanda Tay Ke Xin through work. As our professional communication evolved into more personal conversations, Amanda began to flirt with me and hinted that if I could prove my commitment, a romantic future between us might be possible.</p>

    <p>4. Amanda shared that she was in financial distress due to her vape business. Moved by care and belief in her, I supported her emotionally and financially. I transferred her a total of SGD $2,000 to help with her supposed debt.</p>

    <p>5. Shortly after receiving the money, Amanda began to distance herself from me. She claimed she was busy, reduced communication, and when I tried to seek more interaction, she called me “annoying.”</p>

    <p>6. Later, I discovered Amanda had secretly won SGD $17,000 through online gambling—a platform I had introduced her to. Despite her windfall, she continued to take money from me without disclosing this. This deeply hurt me.</p>

    <p>7. On or about 16 August 2024, Amanda admitted she had lied about her financial situation and confessed she had been “complaining for fun.” Despite her gambling win, she accepted another SGD $400 from me, rationalizing that I had given it willingly.</p>

    <p>8. This admission led me to terminate the relationship, realizing I had been emotionally manipulated and financially exploited.</p>

    <p>9. Shortly after the breakup, I learned from Amanda’s roommate that Amanda had repeatedly brought other men into her home and engaged in sexual activities with them during our relationship. This directly contradicted her claims of exclusivity and commitment.</p>

    <p>10. Throughout our relationship, I noticed multiple red flags—hearing male voices in the background during our calls and once catching her video chatting with another man. When I questioned her, Amanda dismissed my concerns and gaslit me, calling me insecure and overly sensitive.</p>

    <p>11. In October 2024, Amanda reached out to me again. She claimed she had been molested and asked for my help to “settle” the matter. Despite our prior fallout, I agreed to hear her out due to my strong sense of justice.</p>

    <p>12. Amanda insisted that no one else would help her and pressured me emotionally. Upon looking into the situation, I found that she had voluntarily entered a closed apartment with the alleged perpetrator. This raised doubts about the full nature of her claim.</p>

    <p>13. She demanded compensation from the man involved. I negotiated a resolution, during which he paid her SGD $2,000 and replaced a mattress. Once the issue was resolved, Amanda disappeared again without further contact or gratitude.</p>

    <p>14. In June 2025, Amanda returned once more. She appeared physically and emotionally deteriorated—underweight, missing a tooth, unemployed, and in debt. She expressed vulnerability and claimed she had no one else in her life.</p>

    <p>15. Amanda became emotionally affectionate again, hugging me, kissing me, and telling me she loved me. She implied she was ready for a real relationship this time and said she had changed. I believed her.</p>

    <p>16. Despite everything, I helped her again. I worked with her, gave her more money, and supported her emotionally and financially—once more. I even gave her money for gambling, trusting her words and believing this time was different.</p>

    <p>17. On 31 May 2025, I experienced what would become the final breaking point in our relationship: Amanda handed me a nearly empty KPod with only 0.2ml of liquid, while concealing a full one in her pants—something I only discovered while hugging her.</p>

    <p>18. When I confronted her, she lied—first claiming she didn’t know because she had been asleep, then changing her story to say it was meant for both of us. Her explanations were inconsistent and disingenuous.</p>

    <p>19. I had recently paid SGD $250 for three KPods she claimed hadn’t arrived. The fact that she had a full pod contradicted her claims and cast doubt on both the delivery and her statements about her condition.</p>

    <p>20. Amanda also claimed to have been asleep for over 12 hours due to withdrawal symptoms, yet she somehow acquired and concealed a new KPod during that time.</p>

    <p>21. This incident, while materially small, symbolized everything wrong in our dynamic. It proved that even after everything I had given—emotionally, financially, and personally—Amanda still chose lies and selfishness over honesty and care.</p>

    <p>22. Once again, she disappeared after receiving my money and attention. As of the date of this affidavit, Amanda Tay Ke Xin has not apologized or taken responsibility for her actions.</p>

    <p>23. She has also asked me to cover expenses beyond what is reasonable, including requests for money for dental surgery and allowance for her father—despite her already receiving considerable sums from me over time.</p>

    <p>24. Amanda Tay Ke Xin’s behavior over this period shows a sustained pattern of emotional manipulation, exploitation of goodwill, financial abuse, and deception. I feel deeply betrayed, used, and emotionally drained by the experience.</p>

    <p>25. I make this affidavit truthfully to document these events and preserve a factual record of the harm caused.</p>
