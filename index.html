    <h1 style="text-align:center; text-transform:uppercase;">Affidavit of Facts</h1>

    <p>This affidavit documents a series of events involving Amanda Tay Ke Xin between July 2024 and June 2025. It outlines patterns of deceit, financial exploitation, emotional manipulation, and betrayal of trust.</p>

    <h3>📍 July 2024 – Relationship Initiation</h3>
    <p>Amanda met the undersigned through work. She gradually transitioned professional conversations into flirtatious, romantic exchanges—implying a future together if commitment was shown. She claimed financial hardship from a vape business and received SGD $2,000 in support.</p>

    <h3>📍 August 2024 – Lies Revealed</h3>
    <p>Communication declined. Amanda became distant and dismissive. It was later discovered she had won SGD $17,000 through online gambling—a platform introduced by the undersigned—yet continued to request money, hiding her winnings.</p>
    <p>On 16 August 2024, Amanda admitted she had lied about her finances and claimed she had been “complaining for fun.” She accepted another SGD $400 post-win. This exposed a pattern of financial deceit.</p>

    <h3>📍 Infidelity & Gaslighting</h3>
    <p>Amanda’s roommate later confirmed she had brought other men home while maintaining romantic ties and taking money. This was consistent with prior red flags: male voices during calls and being caught video chatting another man. Confronted, Amanda gaslit and dismissed concerns as insecurity.</p>

    <h3>📍 October 2024 – Manipulating Justice</h3>
    <p>Amanda reconnected claiming she had been molested and demanded help settling the matter. Emotional appeals followed. Investigation revealed she had entered the alleged perpetrator’s home voluntarily. Despite doubts, the undersigned negotiated a SGD $2,000 settlement and mattress replacement. She disappeared afterward.</p>

    <h3>📍 June 2025 – Return in Distress</h3>
    <p>Amanda returned physically and emotionally deteriorated—underweight, toothless, jobless, and deeply in debt. She showed affection, claimed to be loyal, and reignited romantic interest. Trusting her again, the undersigned resumed financial and emotional support, including funds for gambling.</p>

    <h3>📍 31 May 2025 – The KPod Incident</h3>
    <p>Amanda gave a nearly empty vape pod (0.2ml) to the undersigned while hiding a full one in her pants—discovered during a hug. Her story changed repeatedly: first unaware, then “meant for both.” This highlighted her ongoing dishonesty.</p>
    <p>SGD $250 had already been paid for KPods she claimed were never delivered. Her behavior cast serious doubt on both the delivery and her integrity.</p>

    <h3>📍 Final Betrayal</h3>
    <p>Amanda’s unwillingness to share a basic item symbolized deeper disregard. After all support—thousands in cash, emotional labor, time—she chose to lie again. She disappeared, showing no gratitude or remorse.</p>

    <h3>📍 Behavioral Pattern</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Exploited emotional support for financial gain</li>
      <li>✅ Repeated manipulation using sympathy and fabricated claims</li>
      <li>✅ Demonstrated infidelity and emotional betrayal</li>
      <li>✅ Took funds under false pretenses, including gambling and personal expenses</li>
      <li>✅ Disappeared after receiving support, showing no accountability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To date, Amanda Tay Ke Xin has not offered an apology or any acknowledgment of the harm caused. Her actions reflect a sustained, calculated pattern of manipulation and exploitation. This affidavit is a factual record of those events.</p>
